 We are going to play a little game, simulating what binary search is in this first example.


 
 
 
Click on the numbers to select them.
 
 
 
 Hint: If there are an even number of n elements in the list, such as 4. Then the middle value is n/2 --> or the second element.




 If there were eight values, then the middle value would be the fourth element



 If you are done, click [here](@next) to go to the next game!
